                    <p>Sleep is an essential time for physical and mental health recovery, and people spend more than one-third of their lives sleeping. Sleep quality plays a crucial role in learning, fatigue recovery, and daily life. Furthermore, insufficient sleep can decrease concentration during the day, contribute to daytime sleepiness, and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and obesity. Furthermore, prolonged sleep deprivation causes insomnia, which interferes with work, family, and healthy life. The paradigm of global healthcare is changing from diagnosis and treatment to prevention, prediction, and personalization. Sleep must be monitored accurately to prevent sleep disorders and provide customized solutions.</p>

                    <p>Polysomnography (PSG) is a systematic process for assessing sleep. PSG measures the following biosignals during the night: electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG), respiration, SpO2, and other signals. The sleep stages are classified based on these signals. They are divided into five distinct stages based on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM): wake, non-rapid eye movement (NREM stages 1-3), and rapid eye movement (REM). The sleep stages are scored in 30-second units based on the characteristics of the biosignals. Sleep scoring is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. To solve these limitations, an automatic sleep scoring studies have been published. Automatic sleep classification research is divided into studies that classify sleep stages into three, four, or five stages. When the sleep stages are divided into three, they are classified as wake, NREM, and REM. In the case of four stages, they are classified as wake, light sleep (NREM1+NREM2), deep sleep (NREM3), and REM sleep. With five stages, the stages are classified as wake, NREM1-3, and REM sleep. The classification of sleep stages three, four, or five in the papers to be reviewed later means the above division.</p>
