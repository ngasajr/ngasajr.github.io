                <p class="blog-post-date">Posted on: August 15, 2024</p>

                <div class="blog-post-content">
                    <p>Sleep is an essential time for physical and mental health recovery, and people spend more than one-third 
                        of their lives sleeping. Sleep quality plays a crucial role in learning, fatigue recovery, and daily life.
                        Furthermore, insufficient sleep can decrease concentration during the day, contribute to daytime sleepiness, 
                        and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and obesity. Furthermore, prolonged sleep deprivation causes 
                        insomnia, which interferes with work, family, and healthy life. The paradigm of global healthcare is 
                        changing from diagnosis and treatment to prevention, prediction, and personalization. Sleep must be monitored 
                        accurately to prevent sleep disorders and provide customized solutions.
                    </p>

                    <p>Polysomnography (PSG) is a systematic process for assessing sleep. PSG measures the following biosignals 
                        during the night: electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), electrocardiogram (ECG), 
                        electromyogram (EMG), respiration, SpO2, and other signals. The sleep stages are classified based on these 
                        signals. They are divided into five distinct stages based on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM): 
                        wake, non-rapid eye movement (NREM stages 1-3), and rapid eye movement (REM). The sleep stages are scored in
                        30-second units based on the characteristics of the biosignals. Sleep scoring is a time-consuming and 
                        labor-intensive process. To solve these limitations, an automatic sleep scoring studies have been published.
                        Automatic sleep classification research is divided into studies that classify sleep stages into three, four,
                        or five stages. When the sleep stages are divided into three, they are classified as wake, NREM, and REM. 
                        In the case of four stages, they are classified as wake, light sleep (NREM1+NREM2), deep sleep (NREM3), 
                        and REM sleep. With five stages, the stages are classified as wake, NREM1-3, and REM sleep. The 
                        classification of sleep stages three, four, or five in the papers to be reviewed later means the above 
                        division.

                            <li>Sleep stage classification also known as sleep scoring or sleep staging
                             is the classification of 30-seconds periods of PSB (called "epochs") in different
                             sleep stages
                            </li>
                            <li>This task of sleep stage classification is done visually by a sleep expert-who
                                mostly rely on guidelines (e.g., proposed by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine
                                (AASM) for determination of sleep stages.

                            <li>Each Epoch is classified into one of the following five sleep stages:

                                The manual annotation of the recorded data is a complex and time-intensive process
                                which takes a well-trained physician up to two hours to score one whole hynogram of 
                                about 8 hours of sleep.
                            </li>

                                Sleep stage classification is prone to subjective bias, resulting in lower then desired inter-scorer
                                and intra-scorer agreement.
