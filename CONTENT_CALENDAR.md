# Content Calendar (Next 12 Weeks)

Use this 12-week schedule as a repeatable quarterly cadence. Each week has a single, manageable deliverable that keeps your portfolio and blog active without overloading you.

## Cadence
- **Blog**: 1 post every 2–3 weeks (alternating short and medium-length posts).
- **Portfolio**: 1 refresh every 4–6 weeks (new project, results, or update).
- **Promotion**: 1 short update to social channels or professional networks per new post.
